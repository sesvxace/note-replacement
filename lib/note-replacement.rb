# Note Replacement v2.0 by Solistra
# =============================================================================
# 
# Summary
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   This is a simple script that allows you to replace any text that you define
# with another set of text in any note box. You may use strings, symbols, or
# even regular expressions as tags, then define the text that replaces them
# with a string or a block of Ruby code that returns a string (for the truly
# insane). If you need to access the original state of the note box before
# replacements are done, you can call the `original_note` method on the object.
# 
#   By default, this works with maps, actors, classes, skills, items, weapons,
# armors, enemies, states, and tilesets -- basically, anything with notes.
# 
# Caveats
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   **NOTE:** This warning only applies to *dynamically* generated note tags --
# simple replacements work exactly as intended as long as you follow the given
# installation instructions. Your replacements are going to work absolutely
# fine as long as you are not using a Proc object to generate them.
# 
#   Generally, script authors assume that note tag information will remain
# static -- notes are defined in the database, and the database is where static
# game information is stored. Unfortunately, this means that most scripts will
# actually _cache_ note tag information instead of actually collecting the note
# from the object when it is needed. As such, if the script is using a cache of
# note tags, it will *never* be aware that the note has been replaced if you 
# dynamically generate note tag contents.
# 
#   **This is not a failing of the note replacer.** It's a bad assumption that
# note tag information will not change, and therefore has no need to be checked
# after the initial loading of the game. There is nothing that this script can
# do to change that.
